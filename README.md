## üíªNote

D2L++ was inspired by Better Canvas and Darklight. Seeing the need for dark themes and additional features for the Brightspace LMS, this extension was created. While some elements may not yet be themed, improvements and updates are continuously being made.
- If something is missing or not working properly, email me, and I will add/fix it in the next version.
- This was tested on: MyLearningSpace (UofLaurier), Waterloo Learn (UofWaterloo), and WRDSB School Board. If you have another version of D2L and some features are not working for you, I do not have access to that version of D2L to test and fix, so please contribute if you can!
